# AI-Hypothyroidism-prediction
Hypothyroidism is categorized into four groups. Experimental results demonstrate that RF achieved 99.81% accuracy compared with KNN, DT, and SVM algorithms. The study [16] investigated three feature selection approaches using DT, SVM, RF, naive Bayes (NB), and LR for the prediction of hypothyroidism.
